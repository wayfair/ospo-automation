## About The Project

Automation workflows for Wayfair's [Open Source Program Office](https://wayfair.github.io).

## Basic Usage

Currently, the OSPO Automation project has a single workflow available for creating repository forks.

To trigger this job manually, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [Actions](https://github.com/wayfair/ospo-automation/actions) tab of the project
2. Locate the workflow you wish to run - in this case: [fork](https://github.com/lelia/ospo-platform/actions/workflows/fork.yml)
3. Under the run history, you should see: `This workflow has a workflow_dispatch event trigger`
4. Click the `Run workflow` button next to this message, and a dialogue box should open
5. Fill out the required [inputs](https://github.com/wayfair-incubator/forker#inputs) to run the `forker` action
6. Click the green `Run workflow` button at the bottom to manually trigger the workflow
7. Watch your workflow spin into action in the run history!

## Adding Workflows

1. Clone the repository:
