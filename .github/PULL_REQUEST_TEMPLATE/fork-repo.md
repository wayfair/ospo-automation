# 🔁 Fork a repository

## Description

This PR template is intended for requesting [repository forks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) into the [`/wayfair-contribs`](https://github.com/wayfair-contribs) organization, to enable upstream contributions to existing open source projects. **You must already be a GitHub organization member of `/wayfair-contribs`** (and preferrably, [`/wayfair`](https://github.com/wayfair) + [`/wayfair-incubator`](https://github.com/wayfair-incubator) as well) **in order to use this workflow**. The repository you are requesting a fork of must also comply with our current list of approved open source licenses: **MIT**, **BSD** (3-clause, 2-clause, 0-clause), **Apache** (1.0, 1.1, 2.0).

> 🚨  If you aren't already a member of Wayfair's open source GitHub organizations, please refer to internal Wayfair OSPO documentation on adding yourself to the `ospo-names` repository, or reach out on our internal Slack channel (`#open-source-forum`) if you need further assistance!

## Instructions

> **💡 Please follow all instructions in the [Fork a repository README](requests/fork/README.md) before filing your Pull Request using this template!**

## Checklist

- [ ] I have confirmed that I am already a member of the `/wayfair-contribs` GitHub organization
- [ ] I have confirmed that the repository I wish to fork is compliant with our [approved list of licenses](#description)
- [ ] I have reviewed the [Fork a repository README] and created a compliant `.yml` request file
- [ ] I have created a git branch name which follows the documented pattern of `fork-repo-<REPO-NAME>`

> 💡 In the initial rollout of this workflow, requests filed as PRs will be semi-automated, with some manual verification and processing still performed by the OSPO team upon receipt. However, in the future, this workflow will become fully self-serviceable through automated PR checks and GitHub Actions-driven workflows! 🎉
