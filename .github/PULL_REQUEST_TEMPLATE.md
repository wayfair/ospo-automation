# 🔁 Fork a repository

🚨 INSTRUCTIONS: Click the `Preview` tab above, then follow along below!

## Description

This PR template is intended for Wayfair developers requesting [repository forks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) into the [`/wayfair-contribs`](https://github.com/wayfair-contribs) organization, to enable upstream contributions to existing open source projects.

**You must already be a GitHub organization member of [`/wayfair-contribs`](https://github.com/wayfair-contribs)** (and preferrably, [`/wayfair`](https://github.com/wayfair) + [`/wayfair-incubator`](https://github.com/wayfair-incubator) as well) **in order to use this workflow**. The repository you are requesting a fork of must also comply with our current list of approved open source licenses: **MIT**, **BSD** (3-clause, 2-clause, 0-clause), **Apache** (1.0, 1.1, 2.0).

> 💡 If you aren't already a member of Wayfair's open source GitHub organizations, please refer to internal Wayfair OSPO documentation on adding yourself to the `ospo-names` repository, or reach out on our internal Slack channel (`#open-source-forum`) if you need further assistance!

## Instructions
